# Description
In this code we solved the classification problem of detecting what number is written in a picture using keras tensorflow package in python. We use as input a MNIST black and white picture of a digit and output the detected number which is between 0 and 9.

We are using a multi layer perceptron, with RELU and sigmoid as actiovation functions.

To prevent overfitting we decided to implement EarlyStopping.
